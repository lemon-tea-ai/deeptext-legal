            <h2>2. Information We Don't Collect</h2>
            <p>DeepText is designed with privacy in mind. We want to be clear about what we don't collect:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We do not collect or store your photos or videos</li>

            <h2>3. Local Processing</h2>
            <p>All image and video processing occurs locally on your device. Your media files never leave your device during the text extraction process.</p>

            <h2>4. App Store Data</h2>
            <p>When you purchase a subscription through the App Store, Apple provides us with limited information necessary to verify your subscription status. This is handled through Apple's privacy-preserving systems.</p>
